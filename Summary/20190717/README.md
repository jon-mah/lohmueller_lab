Continued working on pipeline. Generated DFE and demography for given arctic wolf, labrador, and pug data. Gave `SLiM` AW gamma DFE and trying to re-infer it.

## Next steps
1.  Reduce the genome size, similar to what Eduardo suggested on `Slack`.
2.  Scale down by 10.
3.  Remove introns, no scaling.
4.  Coalescent trees.

## Quick meeting with Eduardo
*  Introns are 1 base pair
*  Recombination rate is 3500 times higher
