Meeting with Kirk, Eduardo, Miguel, Jesse (in spirit)
* Miguel put together a time-point analysis, where he compares the ancestral DFE, the shifted DFE, and then the inferred DFE.
* At the time of the shift, demography changes from Arctic wolves to Pugs.
* Part of the variation may be due to noise, i.e., because this time analysis was done on reduced-size data.
* Look at demographic parameters and model for 100,000 generation simulation.

    * Inference a long time after an ancient contraction will look weird.
    * No shift-case is a control experiment.
    * Look specifically at demographic model and SFS at different time points, especially for the 100,000 generations case.
    * Look into why the inference of no-shift DFE does not match ancestral DFE (it should be the same).
    * Continue trying with Na=2000, but without contraction. (1-epoch model)
    * Done with both pugs, and with a more dramatic shift.
    * Shift to a more neutral DFE.

        * Cut most deleterious bin by half
        * Increase more neutral bin by half.
        * Lower the mean -- increase the scale.
        * Increase shape? To maybe 0.2.

* Changing the population size might be doing something funky -- instead, we could look at **only** shifting the DFE, but keeping the same ancestral population.

    * If we do this, then we should use the 1-epoch model.

* Estimating DFE's from contracted species is novel.

* If you have a demographic model or DFE, you can generate a model SFS.

* Logistics:

    * Come up with a regular meeting time.
    * Let's see how Miguel's semester is looking (it starts in ~1.5 weeks).

* Directions on Manuscript:

Simulations are more interesting in light of data, so at this stage it makes more sense to keep the analysis and simulations to be kept together..

1. (more likely)
    * Eduardo's results
    * Simulation Results
    * Conclude something

2.
    * Two separate paper:
    * One that's more simulation-heavy (with lots of interesting results)

Undergrad Involvement:
* Closer to minimal side of actual writing up paper.
* Involved with writing up the methods.
* We'll be authors on the manuscripts.
