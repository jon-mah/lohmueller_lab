Today we simulated the neutral evolution of genomes from 10 populations, each consisting of 100 people, which can be found in `../../Scripts/pilot_neutral_sim.R`. From these populations, we output 10 Variant Call Format (vcf) files. We also wrote an `R` script to compute the site-frequency-spectrum (sfs) for each vcf file.
