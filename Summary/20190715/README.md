1.  Simulated some population under a gamma-distributed DFE, run the inference pipeline and see if it matches. Compare `SFS`.

2.  Simulate populations such that we expect them to have a shift in DFE. Run inference pipeline and see if there is a detectable difference.

## Miguel
*  `SLiM` simulations.
*  Burn in period of 12N_a.
*  Vary alpha and beta of gamma-distributed DFE.
*  Vary time since change in DFE.
*  Try 5000 generations ~ 20,000 years, which is when people think dogs were domesticated.
*  Second scenario, do everything with dog demography and dog DFE.

## Jon
*  Simulate things.
*  Make pipeline more robust.
*  Make pipeline readable.
