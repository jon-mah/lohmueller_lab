##### DADI FITDADI ######
#########################

In this directory you can find the most recent scripts and SFS files I used to run Dadi (2ep.py) and FitDadi (NS*py) for PG (pug), LB (Labrador), and AW (Arctic Wolf).

For now, let's focus on AW, and then on LB. I might need to re-do the estimates for PG using 3-epochs model. 

Sample sizes are all projected down to N=8 with easySFS.

The number file "8pops_results.numbers" has two tabs. The first one is the output of the DADI runs for syn sites.
There are more than just AW, PG, LB, but you can ignore the others for now.
For each population, I have 10 runs. I do that to make sure the estimates are converging to a similar value. 

The second tab "Scenarios" has the demographic scenarios, and selective and genetic parameters. See below.

### Demography, Genetic parameters, and DFE ###
###############################################

See table "Scenarios." Ignore "OLD RUN" lines for now. See lines 2 (AW), 3 (LB), and 4 (PG).

## DEMOGRAPHY ##
The demographic parameters are given in columns C, D, E, H, I, J. 
C-E are the outputs of DADI and are given in units relative to Ne.
I need the sequence length (Lsyn column G) and mutation rate (u column F) to scale these parameters to real values. 
Real values are given in columns H-J. Eg. AW has an ancestral population of ~80K individuals then it goes through a bottleneck 1786 generations ago reducing its population size to ~12.5K.
These are the values Miguel will use.

## GENETIC ##
Miguel will also need:
- Mutation rate (u) for exons = 6.7250E-09
- Ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions = 2.14 (ask me if you didn't understand what is this) 
- Sequence length. For AW we can get the sequence length by multiplying the number of covered syn sites (Lsyn = 5,144,295) to 2.14 = 11,008,791 <- I want to re-estimate that independently for NS sites, but won't have time to do it now. Let's use this value meanwhile.
- Average exon length: we can use for now 200bp, as is for humans. This is not a big deal. We just want to introduce some effect of background selection in a realistic way. If the SFSs don't look right, we can make it more realistic by using a distribution for exon lengths.

## SELECTION ##
The parameters for the gamma distribution of s (selection coefficient) are in columns M and N. For AW these are shape=0.0980 and scale=4.9260. 
Note that SLIM may use rate instead of scale parameter for the gamma distribution. If that's the case, then instead of scale = 4.9260 you should use rate = 1/4.9260. Please talk to me if this doens't make sense. I might be mistaken about it.

Miguel, we talked about using 100, 5K and 10K generations for the change in the DFE. Correct? 
I realized the size change occurs at ~1.786 generations ago. So, let's do: 100 (recent, as Kirk suggested), 1000 (intermediate), and 1786 (together with the bottleneck) generations ago?
