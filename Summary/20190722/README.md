## Next steps:
*  Work with smaller ancestral population size, e.g., N_a = 2000. Use this to check if we correctly infer DFE and demography.
*  Look at job arrays, e.g., split genome into 8 2Mb base pairs and run parallel.
*  Look at recapitation.
*  Compute relative fitness.
*  Check if DFE is correct -- plot out Eduardo's DFE using his sheet.
    *  Plot out Eduardo's DFE using his sheet.
    *  Plot out DFE using your `SLiM` pipeline.
