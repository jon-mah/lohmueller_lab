Today we worked on `create_2d_sfs.R`, which takes in two `.vcf` files and returns a two-dimensional Site Frequency Spectrum (sfs).

# Next steps
*  Learn easySFS on Hoffman2
*  Figure out how to output a single `.vcf` comprised of individuals from two populations.

        P_1 = individuals --> sample individuals from P_1
        P_2 = individuals --> sample individuals from P_2
        Combine two samples into P_3 (or something)
        P_3.outputVCFsample()

*  Get comfortable with installing/using things on hoffman2.
*  Learn how to use fastsimcoal for demographic inference
*  Get more comfortable with SLiM.
