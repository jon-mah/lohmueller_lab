    VCF file uses non-standard Chrom/pos information.
    We assume that Chrom indicates RAD loci and pos indicates snps within each locus 
    The VCF file passed does not have rad locus info in the Chrom field.

    You can re-run the easySFS conversion with the `-a` flag to use all snps in the conversion.
